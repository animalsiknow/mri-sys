# mri-sys

This crate contains low-level bindings to MRI, including secret APIs.

## Compiling this crate

This crate needs a full installation of Ruby, including header files. Internal header files are vendored, so you do not need to check out the Ruby source. It will be automatically configured to work with whichever Ruby is found in your `PATH`.
